<p>My name is Celine Irvene, and I am currently a PhD student at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">the Georgia Institute of Technology
</a>. Go Jackets! My technical interests include software engineering, CPS security, and machine learning. I enjoy traveling,
shopping, playing basketball, and learning new things.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain">
    Stone Mountain Park</a>, site of the largest bas-relief in the world. I've lived in Georgia my entire life, but have been blessed
    enough to travel to 14 countries and visit 20 states. I hope some day to completely fill the map below.</p>

<h2>Career Interests</h2>
<p> They say if you do what you love you'll never work a day in your life. Well, I love working on new an exciting

    technologies that make a difference.</p>
