<p>My name is Celine Irvene, and I am currently a PhD student at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">the Georgia Institute of Technology
</a>. Go Jackets! My technical interests include software engineering, CPS security, and machine learning. I enjoy traveling,
shopping, playing basketball, and learning new things.</p>
<p>I was born and raised and in Stone Mountain, Georgia known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain">
    Stone Mountain Park</a>, site of the largest bas-relief in the world. I've lived in Georgia my entire life, but have been blessed
    enough to travel to 14 countries and visit 20 states. I hope some day to completely fill the map below.</p>

<p>In 2007, I moved to the Kansas City Metro Area&mdash;which I now consider home more than Wichita, even after
    subsequently moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2013. I'll always be a midwesterner at heart, but I love to explore
    new places and new opportunities.</p>
